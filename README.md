# Netflix_Clone

A simple Netflix homepage clone built using HTML and CSS, featuring a responsive layout, dark-themed UI, and interactive hover effects. The design replicates Netflix’s look using Flexbox and Grid for structured styling. No frameworks were used—just pure HTML and CSS. Clone the repo and open Netflix.html to explore the design. Feel free to contribute and enhance the project!
